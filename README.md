Design Decisions 

During my design of the Pokedex web application, I wanted to keep simplicity in mind
and ensure that the design was user-friendly.

> I utilizied grids throughout the web application to organize the content into manageable
chunks. As well as to ensure ease of use whilst the user is scrolling through large amounts
of content. 

> I utilized a pastel colour palette to avoid taking too much focus away from the images of 
the pokemon whilst still trying to be playful. 

> I included large margins throughout the desktop version to minimize the space the content
takes up and to make it easier for the user to view the content without getting distracted. 

>  I incorporated a bold sans-serif font to draw the users attention, as well as, to improve
the ease of reading through paragraphs of content. 

> I included playful icons throughought to remind the user to have fun and enjoy the site.
